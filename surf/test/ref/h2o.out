 # WARNING: ¡¡¡ ABOUT PARALLELIZATION !!!
 # By now only the OMP model is used. The following 
 # parts of the code of IQA and no others are parallelized :
 # 
 # a) The binary code used to compute the RDM matrices 
 # b) The check of the beta-sphere radii 
 # c) The determination of the atomic surfaces 
 # d) The computation of the angular averages 
 # e) The computation of the bicentric terms 
 # f) The romberg and different reduction like operations 
 # g) The angular averages in the aom task 
 # 
 # Some results can be different when they are compared 
 # with a version that it is not parallelized, this is 
 # because at the end of the regions for which the reduction
 # clause was specified, the original object is updated to 
 # reflect the result of combining its original value with 
 # the final value of each of the private copies using the 
 # operator specified. The reduction operators are all 
 # associative (except for subtraction), and the compiler 
 # may freely reassociate the computation of the final 
 # value. Furthermore, different degrees of parallelism may 
 # result in different numeric results because of changes 
 # in the association of numeric operations. For example, 
 # a serial addition reduction may have a different 
 # pattern of addition associations than a parallel 
 # reduction. These different associations may change the 
 # results of floating-point addition. Usually these 
 # differences are small, near the machine precision, 
 # but can acumulate up to 1d-6/1d-7 differences. 
 # 
 # When using the OMP model, some problems related with 
 # the stack size can occuor, specially with the intel  
 # compiler, to avoid this issue, the following         
 # enviormental variables should be exported, for the   
 # bash shell for example                               
 # 
 # a) export OMP_STACK_SIZE=128m                        
 # b) export KMP_STACK_SIZE=128m
